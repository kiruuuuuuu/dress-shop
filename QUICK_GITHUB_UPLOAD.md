## 📝 Step-by-Step Instructions

### Step 1: Create GitHub Repository (2 minutes)

1. **Open your browser** and go to: https://github.com/new

2. **Fill in the form:**
   - Repository name: `dress-shop` (or your choice)
   - Description: `Full-stack online dress shopping portal`
   - Choose: **Public** or **Private**
   - ❌ **DON'T** check any boxes (README, .gitignore, license)

3. **Click "Create repository"**

4. **KEEP THIS PAGE OPEN** - you'll need the URL!

---

### Step 2: Run These Commands (3 minutes)

**Open PowerShell in your project folder** and run these commands **ONE BY ONE**:

```powershell
# 1. Make sure you're in the right directory
cd "C:\Users\kiruk\OneDrive\Desktop\online shopping paid"

# 2. Add all files
git add .

# 3. Create first commit
git commit -m "Initial commit: Full-stack dress shop with all features"

# 4. Add GitHub as remote (REPLACE WITH YOUR GITHUB URL!)
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/dress-shop.git

# 5. Push to GitHub
git push -u origin master
```

**Important:** In step 4, replace `YOUR-USERNAME` with your actual GitHub username!

---

### Step 3: Enter Credentials (When Prompted)

When you run `git push`, it will ask for:

- **Username:** Your GitHub username (e.g., `kirankiru` or whatever yours is)
- **Password:** Use a **Personal Access Token** (NOT your GitHub password!)

---

## 🔑 How to Get Personal Access Token

If you don't have a token yet:

1. Go to: https://github.com/settings/tokens
2. Click **"Generate new token"** → **"Generate new token (classic)"**
3. Give it a name: `DressShop Upload`
4. **Check the "repo" checkbox** (gives full repository access)
5. Click **"Generate token"** at the bottom
6. **COPY THE TOKEN** (starts with `ghp_...`) - You won't see it again!
7. Paste this as your password when pushing

---

## 🎯 Example Commands With Your Setup

```powershell
# Navigate to project
cd "C:\Users\kiruk\OneDrive\Desktop\online shopping paid"

# Stage all files
git add .

# Commit
git commit -m "Initial commit: DressShop application"

# Add remote (EXAMPLE - use your actual username!)
git remote add origin https://github.com/kirankiru/dress-shop.git

# Push
git push -u origin master
```

## ❓ Troubleshooting

### Problem: "remote origin already exists"

**Solution:**
```powershell
git remote remove origin
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/dress-shop.git
```

### Problem: "Support for password authentication was removed"

**Solution:** You need a Personal Access Token (see section above)

### Problem: Shows too many files (like C:\Users\...)

**Solution:** Make sure you're in the project directory:
```powershell
pwd
# Should show: C:\Users\kiruk\OneDrive\Desktop\online shopping paid

# If not, navigate there:
cd "C:\Users\kiruk\OneDrive\Desktop\online shopping paid"
```
